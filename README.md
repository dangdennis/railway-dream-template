## Overview

This is a simple, bare-bones [Dream](https://aantron.github.io/dream/) app that
serves an HTML page.

Dream is a tidy web framework written in OCaml. It offers a great starting point
for anyone interested in writing OCaml for their next web application. With a
great type system and feature-full set of APIs, you'll have a great time trying
out Dream.
